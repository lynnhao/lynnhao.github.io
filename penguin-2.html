            <p class="dsgn-process text-center">Design Process</p>
            <p class="body">Penguin is a social media application designed to connect people anonymously by mutual interests in a fun way. Short, unrestricted messages broadcasted nearby allows users to "break the ice", open a private chat, and make like-minded friends.</p>

            <p class="subheader">Finding Design Opportunities from Research</p>
            <p class="body">I was hired in early stages of the start-up to assist with creating graphics for the app. However, after closely working with the team and learning more about their ideas, I saw design opportunities synthesized from user interviews and surveys. I used visual presentations to help the co-founders and the multidisciplinary team understand the process of design-thinking and why it's important to approach design with lean UX. Specifically, Penguin was almost identical to Tinder but targeted a vastly different set of users. From performing user interviews and creating personas, I identified the target audience:<br/><br/>
            <span class="quote">introverted students that need a convenient, unobtrusive way to make friends in a new environment.<br/><br/></span>
            As the lead designer, I helped the Penguin team synthesize design opportunities from user interviews, evaluate breakdowns, and ultimately redesign the interface and branding guidelines.</p>

            <p class="subheader">Branding</p>
            <p class="body">After identifying a user group, I began creating mood boards, brainstorming ideas, and sketching logos to begin constructing a brand for Penguin that would be consistent both internally (within the app) and externally (for marketing purposes).</p>

            </div>

            <p class="subheader">"Breaking The Ice"</p>
            <p class="body">Following several brainstorming sessions with the team to come up with a new schema for user interaction and gestures, I put together a gamified approach to making friends. The main function of the app includes a sequence of two taps to break an iceberg within the application that signifies "breaking the ice" with another person. Swiping down "sinks" the iceberg and indicates lack of interest in a post. If two users break the ice on one another's post, an anonymous group chat opens between them.</p>

I came up with the whole concept and theme to create an experience for users that feels natural and matches with the real world. For example, the sketch on the left represents brainstorming of regeneration of ice so that controls match with how ice might float. Is left to right more natural or right to left?</p>
