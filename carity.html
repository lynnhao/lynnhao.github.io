The course - HCI Design -  culminated in a final presentation with over 100 apps and 7 jurors.</p>

            <p class="dsgn-process text-center">Design Process</p>
            <p class="body">Carity is a mobile web application for people who want to make a difference, but don’t have the time or the money and don’t know where to start. Instead of charities that provide vague descriptions about where your money goes, we allow the selection of specific, actionable causes that clearly show your impact. Our intuitive design allows you to set goals, track progress, and follow through by donating in small &manageable increments to the causes you care about.</p>

            <p class="subheader">User Research</p>
            <p class="body">We were presented with the following prompt:</p>
            <p class="body">Resolutions are the promises we make to ourselves and to others. When trying to keep these promises, technology can be a resource or a liability. An almost infinite supply of entertainment, unplanned interruptions and our own limited time mean that distraction frequently triumphs over even the best of our intentions. Focus on developing technology that supports people as they seek to meaningfully use their time, talent, and resources rather than squander them. The aim is to reduce the friction between intention and outcome. </p>
            <p class="body"> In order to approach such an open-ended prompt, we began our needfinding process through basic questions about people's past and present resolutions. We included subjects from a wide variety of backgrounds, including undergrad and grad students, professionals, etc. in order to cover the most demographics. We found that many people wanted to do good for the world, but felt that the only way to do so is to donate large amounts of time or money. From these responses, we came up with two models and later adopted the current model and formulated a specific problem to tackle:</p>
            <p class="quote">People want to make a difference, but they don’t have the motivation or money to feel like they are making an impact. Those who donate to charities don’t know exactly what their money is being used for.</p>

            <p class="subheader">Storyboarding</p>
            <div class="image-group text-center">
                <a href="img/projects/carity-storyboard.png" data-lightbox="carity" data-title="Storyboard.">
                    <img class="image" src="img/projects/carity-storyboard.png">
                </a>
                <p class="caption"><span class="caption-title">Storyboard.</span> Storyboarding allowed us to step into the shoes of our potential users in order to understand motivations and to target a primary task.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="body">From our storyboarding process, we recognized that our users include two groups of people: 1) those who don't have the time or money to donate but still want to make a difference, and 2) those who feel uneasy because they don't don't know exactly where their money goes to.</p>

            <p class="subheader">Paper Prototyping and Heuristic Evaluations</p>

            <div class="image-group text-center">
                <a href="img/projects/carity-paper.png" data-lightbox="carity" data-title="Rapid Paper Prototyping.">
                    <img class="image" src="img/projects/carity-paper.png">
                </a>
                <p class="caption"><span class="caption-title">Paper Prototypes.</span> Rapid paper prototyping allowed us to test many iterations quickly. The process produced screens ready for heuristic evaluations, from which we gained valuable feedback to refine our product and to implement additional features. The image above shows a progression of early prototyping and following iterations (left to right).</p>
            </div>
            <p class="body">We asked other teams within our class to complete heuristic evaluations of our paper prototypes in order to get substantial, juicy feedback from testing only a few users. They liked the minimal design, but had some trouble with understanding the "Money" vs "Days" label. We went through multiple iterations quickly before achieving a MVP to begin development.</p>

            <p class="subheader">A/B Testing</p>

            <div class="image-group text-center">

                    <img class="image" src="img/projects/carity-test.png">
                </a>
                <p class="caption"><span class="caption-title">Testing Video Screenshot.</span> Screenshot from a video recorded of user interacting with our A/B testing setup using lookback.io. Observations from users interacting with our app on a mobile interface showed us that some buttons were too small and that there was confusion on the available features.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="body">Based on interviews and observations of user behavior, we decided to include more images and easily accessible features on the home screen above the fold. We also made symbols and icons more consistent and clear by using more salient colors and by increasing button padding. Our A/B test addressed overwhelming feedback that adding a way to delete causes directly from the home screen would increase overall ease of use of our app. However, after testing 30 users with Google Analytics, we found the results to be statistically insignificant. Thus we decided to keep the original design, where the delete button is within cause details.</p>

            <p class="subheader">Development</p>
            <p class="body">During this time, we also created a development plan that we updated each week and did weekly update presentations of our progress to our studio class. I worked closely with the developer to implement designs that I prototyped on Sketch3. We used Boostrap as our framework and Node.JS as our developing environment. Through collaboration on Github, we were able to communicate swiftly and make iterations as a unit.

            <div class="subheader">Presentation</div>

            <div class="body">We presented our application before an audience of around 300 students and 7+ jurors, with a poster session following. My visual designs earned us recognition from Sharon Carmichael and Scott Klemmer as the best Visual & Most Purposeful Design.
