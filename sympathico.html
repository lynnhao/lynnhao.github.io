            <p class="dsgn-process text-center">Design Process</p>
            <p class="body">Sympathico is a music streaming application that allows users to organize tracks and discover new artists. From our interviews, we found that people generally choose playlists by a certain mood or activity, and rarely create playlists from scratch. We've catered Sympathico to enhance user experience by categorizing playlists by the most common moods and tasks and allowing customization of pre-made playlists. </p>

            <p class="subheader">User Research</p>
            <p class="body">Our ultimate goal was to design an application that best caters to user needs in specific use cases and scenarios associated with creating playlists. We were interested in how we could leverage user interactions with existing products on the market to synthesize habits and common uses. A combination of user interviewing, during which we recorded videos of walkthrough interactions with lookback.io, and competitive analysis, allowed us to rapidly highlight the most common use cases within our user group.</p>

            <p class="body">We interviewed a total of 9 UC San Diego undergraduate students and extracted a total of 36 use cases, with 22 unique. Of these, the highest occurring cases were:</p>
                <ul class="body">
                    <li>Creating a playlist for a roadtrip/driving</li>
                    <li>Creating a playlist for studying/homework</li>
                    <li>Creating a playlist for a party, and</li>
                    <li>Creating a playlist for exercising/working-out</li>
                </ul>
            <p class="body">People generally created playlists for various activities, but we also found that scattered across the use cases were playlists created for moods like happy, emotional, relaxed, etc. People also accessed playlists for general management (adding/deleting of tracks). Therefore, we decided to focus our application around three main use cases: (1) playlists by mood, (2) playlists by activity, and (3) managing playlists.</p>

            <p class="body">From our research, we found that<br/><br/>
            <span class="quote">users need a way to easily sift through playlists and select appropriate music for a mood or activity.<br/><br/></span></p>

            <p class="subheader">Competitive Analysis</p>
            <p class="body">In order to evaluate features in existing apps, gauge usability, and also gain some design inspiration, we performed a competitive task analysis of Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music. We did laid out information in an excel sheet and did walkthroughs with each platform of the 10 most common task scenarios, highlighting major breakdowns along the way. This method also provided distances (number of steps) to completion of a task.</p>

            <div class="image-group text-center">
                <a href="img/projects/sympa-task.png" data-lightbox="sympathico" data-title="Sample task analysis in Spotify.">
                    <img class="image" src="img/projects/sympa-task.png">
                </a>
                <p class="caption"><span class="caption-title">Sample Task Analysis Result.</span> We used this layout with number of steps, description of action, and screenshot to record information architecture designs in competing applications. We also highlighted breakdowns, not pictured.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="body">From breakdowns, we found that deleting a song from a playlist in Spotify is extremely confusing due to lack of appropriate signifiers. While clicking the icon for "more options" next to track normally includes all actions associated with the item, Spotify allows removing from your Library as opposed to the current playlist. The functions of Library and Playlist aren't distinct. It turns out that the application actually has two easy ways to delete from a playlist-- if you can find them. The first is swiping left, but there are no signifiers to indicate this and swiping right (the more natural of the two) adds a song to the queue. Secondly, you can click the "more options" icon for the whole playlist and choose "edit" to delete. This option requires 5 extra steps to delete a track.</p>

            <p class="body">Another key observation from our interviews was that people rarely create playlists from scratch, and rather, find pre-made playlists and add tracks they like from there. However, current applications aren't catered to this need. Instead, people using Spotify have to either listen to only pre-made selections or add tracks from these playlists individually to their own. There's no option to edit a pre-made playlist.</p>

            <p class="subheader">Wireframing</p>
            <p class="body">After identifying the problem, we began brainstorming design solutions and sketching ideas. We came up with a list of the most commonly used functions from both our use cases and by observation:
            </p>
            <ul class="body">
                <li>Discovering new songs by mood or task</li>
                <li>Searching for tracks</li>
                <li>Accessing recently played items</li>
                <li>Saving tracks</li>
                <li>Viewing currently playing song</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="body">Because of limited functions, we employed a footer-style iOS navigation as opposed to a drop-down hamburger menu, which is generally reserved for apps with many items. This way, users can easily access everything they need from any screen.</p>
            <p class="body">We then organized ideas from our brainstorms onto post-its and drew rapid paper prototypes of main screens.</p>

            <div class="image-group text-center">
                <a href="img/projects/sympa-sketch.jpg" data-lightbox="sympathico" data-title="Rapid paper prototype.">
                    <img class="image" src="img/projects/sympa-sketch.jpg">
                </a>
                <p class="caption"><span class="caption-title">Rapid Paper Prototype.</span> Organization of thoughts on post-its and rapid paper prototyping of potential designs. Iterated during session and referenced our research and task analysis results. Due to project time constraints, we finalized our designs at this time to ensure a minimum viable product by the deadline.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="subheader">Prototyping the MVP & Branding</p>
            <p class="body">Working with a timeline of a week to complete our design process, we finalized a minimum viable product from our wireframes to enter the prototyping phase. I helped my group members get started with Sketch3 and used parallel prototyping to boost creativity and productivity. We separately designed 3 versions of the Discover page, which is the landing page for playlist creation and the main novelty within our app.</p>

            <p class="body">During this time, we also created simple branding guidelines consisting of a color scheme and descriptors of the desired feel/message. <b>Fun, customizable, and personalized</b> were our keywords during this process..</p>

            <div class="image-group text-center">
                <a href="img/projects/sympa_iter.png" data-lightbox="sympathico" data-title="Discover Screen Iterations.">
                    <img class="image" src="img/projects/sympa_iter.png">
                </a>
                <p class="caption"><span class="caption-title">Discover Screen Iterations.</span> Parallel prototyping of Discover screen. We felt that stacked buttons made the main function look too much like a one-time landing page, and selected to proceed with a bilateral layout I introduced. We also went through several iterations of the logo, but finalized with a circle (consistent throughout the app) and headphones layout that I designed.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="subheader">Putting it all together</p>

            <p class="body">Finally, with the main screens fleshed out, I compiled interations using InVision. This required a thorough understanding of our task scenarios and each micro-interation involved. One of the design decisions here included an unobtrusive way to create an extra step serving as confirmation before deletion of a track. Because a pop-up could hinder speed of a user attempting to delete multiple tracks quickly, I decided to include a two-step "delete" to (1) clarify deletion of a track permanenetly, and (2) serve as prevention of error. I also created overlay confirmations (ex. "Added to Playlist") as a timely response and visibiltiy of system status. In total, the prototype required 27 screens, which you can view <a href="https://invis.io/U26I23LDP/">here</a>.</p>
